- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LudwikRydzak
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming especially machine learning and neural networks.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python to write a cleaner code and to be able to implement creative projects that are growing in my head. 

I'd like to create neural network enhanced personal helper app that core could be covered with many different modules.
