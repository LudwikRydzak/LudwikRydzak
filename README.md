O, hi, I haven't see you there! Let me introduce myself.

I’m Ludwik Rydzak, but friends call me Ludwik. (Not very creative nickname but it serves its purpose.)  

I did my computer science engineer's degree and cybersecurity Master's at University of Science and Technology in Wrocław (Poland).
I like programming. Currently I'm learnign Java Spring because I want to be useful at some point, but I'm also intrested in AI. 


If you want to know me a bit better I like math, rubic's cubes and chess (nerd alert!). 

I used to play chess professionaly as a kid, but if you fancy a game I'll try to be delicate. 


Feel free to snoop around my github. It's not much, but it's an honest work.
